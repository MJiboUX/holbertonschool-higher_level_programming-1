Importing function:
>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Matrix should be of type list:
>>> matrix = 5
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Matrix should be type list of lists:
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], "a", 2]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Number of elements should have the same size:
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Divisor must be a number(integer/float):
>>> matrix = [[2, 4, 6], [1, 2, 3]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, "abc")
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: div must be a number

Divisor can't be equal to 0:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
